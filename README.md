A dapp that uses Web3 IPFS technology to securely store crime evidence in a tamper-proof manner. The platform prioritizes transparency by incorporating AI and machine learning to maintain and verify the integrity of the evidence and ensure a high level of trust.

## Why We Built This
We built Evidence Vault to address the issue of unreported criminal cases, providing a secure and anonymous platform for citizens to contribute to justice. Our aim is to empower individuals to overcome the fear of involvement with law enforcement and promote transparency and accountability in addressing crime. Through innovative integration of blockchain, AI/ML technology, and decentralized storage, we strive to create safer and more informed communities, ultimately driving positive societal change.




## Technologies Used and Working

1. Smart Contracts - We wrote our smart contracts in Solidity. We used truffle to run them on a ganache development network and test them and finally deployed them on the Blockchain. We use these contracts to make implement logic and store evidence through ETH transactions.
2. Frontend - We used ReactJS for UI and MaterialUI for styling.
3. Metamask - We utilized MetaMask, a software cryptocurrency wallet designed for Ethereum blockchain interaction. Its browser extension enabled us to access the Ethereum wallet and seamlessly interact with our application.
4. IPFS - IPFS or InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that allows users to store and access files in a decentralized manner. Instead of relying on a central server, IPFS uses a distributed network of nodes to store and share files.
5. Truffle and Ganache - Truffle and Ganache were instrumental in our development process, facilitating smart contract compilation, deployment, and local blockchain testing.
6. Tensorflow - Used to build the Deepfake Deep Learning Models
7. Librosa - Supporting feature extraction from audio signals
8. Flask - Used to build integration APIs serving ML Models
